        <p>Dear Aleph,</p> &nbsp;

        <p> Like </p>&nbsp;<p>Ovid </p>&nbsp;<p> I’ll have no last words.</p>
        <p> This is what it means to die among barbarians.</p> &nbsp;<p>Bar</p> &nbsp; <p>bar</p>&nbsp; <p>bar</p>&nbsp;
        <p> was how the Greeks heard our speech —</p>
        <p> sheep,</p> <p>beasts — </p><p>and so we became</p>&nbsp;
        <p> barbarians.</p>&nbsp;<p> We make them reveal</p>
        <p> the brutes they are, Aleph, by the things</p>
        <p> we make them name.</p>&nbsp;<p> David,</p>&nbsp;
        <p> they tell me, is the one</p>
        <p> one should aspire to, but ever since</p>
        <p> I first heard them say </p>&nbsp;<p>Philistine</p>&nbsp;
        <p> I’ve known I am </p>&nbsp;<p> Goliath</p>&nbsp;
        <p> if I am anything.</p>
