            [Persian Letters]
        </p> 
        <p>BY SOLMAZ SHARIF</p> &nbsp;
        <p>Dear Aleph,</p> 

        <p> Like Ovid: I’ll have no last words.</p>
        <p> This is what it means to die among barbarians. Bar bar bar</p>
        <p> was how the Greeks heard our speech —</p>
        <p> sheep, beasts — and so we became</p>
        <p> barbarians. We make them reveal</p>
        <p> the brutes they are, Aleph, by the things</p>
        <p> we make them name. David,</p>
        <p> they tell me, is the one</p>
        <p> one should aspire to, but ever since</p>
        <p> I first heard them say Philistine</p>
        <p> I’ve known I am Goliath</p>
        <p> if I am anything.</p>
